# Observations when starting a business
Last month when I started crosbysolutions, I was excited to receive my first business mail. It was an unsolicited letter from some IT firm looking to help me register a domain name. In all, I received three such letters from companies looking to prey on new business owners, and while I'm impressed that they have a system set up to alert them to new business registrations and then get the form letter out nice and quickly, some of the content of their letter is clearly predatory. 

## Disclaimers

Yes they have disclaimers at the bottom that the letter is for information and that no action or payment is required, but they're gaining a healthy markup from anyone that decides to take advantage of the convenience provided by the letter, or who doesn't understand how simply they can go about this by themselves.

## Conversion

Firstly, the letter's primary goal is to convert domain name registrations. They appear to have checked availability for [new-business-name].com.au, and with crosbysolutions.com.au being left available (I opted for crosby.solutions) they have pounced. While I have no way of knowing what other URLs they check, I wonder if there are some more expensive tlds that they offer. Perhaps that would justify the mark-up in their offering.

## Mark-up

The three letters offered me one year of registration for $79, $80 and $99. A quick check of availability at some public sites puts the domain at $22, and on sale for $18 for the first year. So that's some healthy markup that they're making. If I was going to spend that much on domains, I'd be coming out with half a dozen variations!

## Benefits

Now they did offer some other added benefits with the registration. Things like:  
- free professional email (forwarding). 
- free (access) to a website builder (additional payment required)
- free security certificate setup. 

None of which would cost them anything, and all can be found freely around the internet. In fact by the time you (pay to) build a website and look for hosting, most hosting services will throw all of this in for free anyway.

## Summary

So what's the moral of this story? The worlds is full of sharks looking to prey on newcomers. It may be exciting to start a new business and receive your first mail. However, a little research and a little support will prevent you spending a lot more than you have to on a simple domain name.

## Crosby Solutions

How much are you currently paying for you domain? Are you also paying for services that would otherwise be available at no extra charge? Crosby Solutions is always happy to sit with you and talk through how your web presence is setup, and audit your obligations and expenses. My setup for the first year will cost me a coffee, not a full tank of petrol.
