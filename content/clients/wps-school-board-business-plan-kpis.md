# What is this site doing?
This site is:
- establishing indicators for the targets in the Business Plan, 
- tracking the reports the school makes to the Board
- providing a searchable database of indicators, progress and reports
- providing a summary of progress towards the Business Plan as a whole

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) sound technical, but in a nutshell are just measurements of how we are progressing towards a target. In our business plan, we have Objectives and Targets. How do we know if we're achieving our targets? We look at the indicators. 

Having all our indicators in one place means we can see at a glance how we are performing against the Business Plan targets. We can also chase up the current progress towards a specific target without having do delve through meeting minutes.

# Why should the site do this?

> "Implementation of Business Plan directions, monitoring of targets and progress of achievements are regularly
reviewed by staff and regular updates are reported to the School Board
for their input."

We have committed to the School presenting updates to the School Board. These presentations can and do take any form, be they oral presentations, Annual Report, slide packs, etc. 

As a result of this statement, the School Board can take one of two stances:
1. They can acknowledge that presentations are made to the Board, without the ability to go into specifics of what was presented when, and by whom.
2. They can maintain a record of this reporting to support the School in its claims of progress towards the Business Plan.

The latter enables the board to be a resource for the school in supporting claims of progress towards the Business Plan targets and objectives.

# How do we do this?

At each Board Meeting, when Business Plan related evidence is presented to the Board, we record:
- which Business Plan directions, targets and progress were presented
- who presented them
- what the evidence of progress was
- how we are tracking against our goal

Ideally we can establish indicators for each of our targets that include quantifiable targets, allowing us to objectively achieve our targets. 

# Who is this for?

This database provides a record for the Board of what has been presented. If the Board were to be asked "What progress towards the Business Plan has the School presented so far?", it would be awkward to have to go to the School to ask for information. 

With that said, it is quite understandable if such a record of progress towards the Business Plan is of value to other parties: 
- The Principal may want to look at which targets remain unfulfilled when planning for the upcoming year.
- There may be desire to select and format summaries of this information for communication with the school community.
